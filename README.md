# Jekyll Base IIGINS

## This is a personal repo, I wouldn't recommend using it.

If you do decide to use this, however, what you'll find is a base
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
project which has been modified for use on the iigins.com website. 

The most prominent package included is
[jekyll-assets](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-assets),
which acts very similar to the Rails asset pipeline.

I plan to keep this up to date with the latest
[Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/),
and
[jQuery 2.2](http://jquery.com/download/#jquery-2-x).
